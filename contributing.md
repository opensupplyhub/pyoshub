# Welcome to pyoshub  contributing guide

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to our project! 

Until we have reached version 0.9 onwards, we are unable to accept community contributions and kindly ask you to contact us directly. 
This is because the code based changes so rapidly that issues and pull requests may become obsolete too fast, which would slow
down the initial creation of the library.

We look forward to your contributions and will communicate this to our customers, and partners.
