===================================

Not all API endpoints are similarly simportant or address common use cases. 

* core API endpoints will be used most commonly to match addresses and upload data
* reference endpoints provide access to data that should be used, if possible, such as country, or sector names
* extended endpoints are for more specific use cases, such as changing facility open/close use cases
* info endpoints may be of less interest to most
* internal endpoints may be retired as there may not be a good use case for most
