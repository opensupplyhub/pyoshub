pyoshub, A Python libarary for the OSH API
===========================================

This repository contains a python library to access the 
`Open Supply Hub <https://opensupplyhub.org>`_ API using python.

.. important::
    The library and this documentation are in constant development until we have reached a stable
    status and release version 1.x
    

How it Works
------------

Connecting with the OSH's API enables users to programmatically query and exchange 
data with the Open Supply Hub.

All users of the API are able to access the data points for facilities available in the 
OSH, including:

- Name
- Address
- OS ID
- GPS coordinates
- Contributor connections
- Number of workers
- Parent company
- Type of product
- Type of processing
- Type of facility

Through our pull connection, API users are able to query the OSH system without having
to add data to the tool.

Push-Pull API
-------------

For users who have data they would like to contribute to the OSH via API, 
access to our push pull API includes the ability to:

- Query the OAR system without having to add data to the tool
- Contribute data to the tool and, for each facility, choose whether or not to be publicly connected with that facility (e.g. as Higg, or as "A service provider")

Access to the push pull API is on an annual subscription basis. In addition to the annual 
subscription fee, there is a one-time on-boarding fee. The OSH team will prepare a custom 
package, depending on individual needs.

Pull API
--------
Pull-only access is for users who would like to programmatically extract data from the OSH, 
but do not have data to contribute to the tool. There are a range of options to suit a 
variety of needs. Contact our team and we'll help build a package that's right for you.

Get Started
-----------
- Have questions about which package is right for you? `Contact the team <https://info.openapparel.org/contact-us>`_ to set up a call. We'll be in touch within two business days.
- Create a free account on the OAR, if you donâ€™t already have one.
- Complete this short form letting us know which package you would like access to [if known].
